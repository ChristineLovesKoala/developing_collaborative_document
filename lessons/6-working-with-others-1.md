### Pull requests and Merge

- in order to get your changes pulled into the original repo → make a pull request for the changes you’ve made in a repository on GitHub. 
- Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and comment.
- When the author/owner of the original repo will determine if your changes are cool → and merge them in.
