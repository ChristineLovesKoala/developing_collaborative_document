### Aim of this section

- Defining Collaborative Documents
- Understading challenges in collaborations
- Introduction to Version Control

#### Questions

- What is collaborative documents for you?
    - Working with many people on a single project: planning and running multi-institution research initiative to collect and analyze data or the process of co-creating, sharing, and updating learning materials for your project.

- What are main challenges?
    - When we code, write text, or create any kind of content using computers, we end up with a collection of files in a folder or directory, also known as a repository, or “repo.”
    - Your contributors for your repo may be spread around the world or working in the same room; they may be working simultaneously or asynchronously and create different versions of a document.

- What is version control?
    - “version control,” the task of managing the many contributions your group makes to shared working documents.

No matter how your group is organized, the work of many contributors needs to be wrangled into a single project. Version control manages this process: it stores a history of changes and who made them, allowing you to revert or go back to earlier versions of those documents, and understand how contributions by different contributors have changed the project over time. You may have used word processing software that has a “changes,” “history” or “revisions” feature, which also allows you to see and revisit any changes to the document: this, too, is a form of version control. 


If you’ve never used any specialized version control software before, it may help to look at some diagrams and define some new terms before you get started [here](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/3.1-collab-vers-github.html).
