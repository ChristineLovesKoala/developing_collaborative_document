### What is GitHub?

**GitHub is online web interface**, it’s designed to share your work, and allows other people to “fork” your project-- meaning they can create an independent copy of your work to test, modify, remix and reuse it.

There's lots to know about GitHub-- it has terrific project management features, a social platform, and communication tools that are useful for any project where a group of people are working together on the same set of documents.
